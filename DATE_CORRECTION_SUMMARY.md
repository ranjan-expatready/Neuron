- `docs/product/*.md` - Product documentation
- `docs/architecture/*.md` - Architecture documentation

## Date Standards Going Forward

**For New Entries:**

- Use current date: **2025-12-01** (or current date when entry is made)
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`
- Always use **2025** as the year (not 2024)

**For Historical Documents:**

- Keep original creation dates
- Only update if document is significantly revised
