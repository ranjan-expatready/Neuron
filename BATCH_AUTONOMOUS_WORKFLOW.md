# Batch Autonomous Workflow

## Practical Solution for Maximum Autonomous Work

**Date:** December 2, 2025

---

## 🎯 The Solution

Since AI agents can't run 24/7 in the background, we use **Batch Autonomous Mode**:

**One command → Agent works through many tasks → Reports progress → Stops when done**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Start Batch Work:

```
@Product Manager/CTO Agent:

Start batch autonomous work. Work through as many tasks as possible.
Process in priority order. Report every 5 tasks. Continue until complete.

Proceed.
```

---

## 📋 What Happens

1. **Agent reads knowledge base**
2. **Selects highest priority task**
3. **Executes task** (assigns to agents, monitors)
4. **Runs tests** (quality check)
5. **Updates knowledge base**
6. **Reports progress** (every 5 tasks)
7. **Selects next task**
8. **Repeats** until complete or session ends

---

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

### Morning:

```
@Product Manager/CTO Agent:

Good morning. Resume batch autonomous work. Continue from where we left off.
Work through as many tasks as possible today.

Proceed.
```

### During Day:

Agent works autonomously, reports every 5 tasks

### End of Day:

Agent reports final status, saves progress

### Next Day:

Resume from saved state

---

## ✅ Completion

**Agent stops when:**

- ✅ All tasks complete
- ✅ All phases complete
- ✅ All requirements covered
- ✅ Test coverage 80%+
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Production ready

---

**This maximizes autonomous work within system constraints! 🚀**
