# Frontend Engineering Governance Notes

- Frontend contributors must run through the bootstrap checklist in `docs/ENGINEERING_GOVERNANCE.md` before working on `frontend/src/**`.
- CI guardrails (`frontend-tests`) cover lint + build commands; run `npm run lint && npm run build` locally.
- Log UX-visible changes in `.ai-memory/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` and in the relevant section of `PRODUCT_LOG.md`.
