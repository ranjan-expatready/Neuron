# Autonomous 24/7 Operation System - Complete ✅

## Run Until Gold-Class Implementation Complete

**Date:** December 2, 2025

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

Your system now has **Autonomous 24/7 Operation** that runs continuously until the entire project is **gold-class implemented**:

1. ✅ **Continuous Work Loop** - Every 15-20 minutes
2. ✅ **Automatic Task Selection** - Highest priority, ready tasks
3. ✅ **Quality Gates** - Tests and coverage after each task
4. ✅ **Completion Check** - After each cycle
5. ✅ **Status Reporting** - Every 2 hours
6. ✅ **Error Handling** - Retry, skip, or alert
7. ✅ **Auto-Stop** - When all criteria met

---

## 🚀 How to Start

### Simple Command (Recommended):

```
@Product Manager/CTO Agent:

Enable autonomous 24/7 operation. Run continuously until the entire project is gold-class implemented. Check completion criteria after each work cycle. Report status every 2 hours. Stop only when all phases are complete, all requirements are covered, test coverage is 80%+, all tests are passing, and production is ready.

Proceed.
```

**That's it!** The system will:

- ✅ Run continuously
- ✅ Work on tasks automatically
- ✅ Check completion after each cycle
- ✅ Report status every 2 hours
- ✅ Stop when complete

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Work Cycle (Every 15-20 Minutes):

1. **Read State:**

   - Read knowledge base
   - Check current tasks
   - Check test results
   - Check requirements coverage

2. **Select Task:**

   - Highest priority (P0 > P1 > P2)
   - Check dependencies
   - Select ready task

3. **Execute:**

   - Break down into assignments
   - Assign to agents
   - Monitor progress
   - Update knowledge base

4. **Quality Check:**

   - Run tests
   - Check coverage
   - Verify quality gates

5. **Completion Check:**
   - All phases complete?
   - All requirements covered?
   - Test coverage 80%+?
   - All tests passing?
   - Production ready?
   - **If all true → Stop!**
   - **If not → Continue**

---

## ✅ Completion Criteria

**Project is gold-class complete when ALL are true:**

- ✅ All 4 phases complete
- ✅ All requirements covered (100%)
- ✅ Test coverage 80%+
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Production ready

**System stops automatically when all criteria are met!**
