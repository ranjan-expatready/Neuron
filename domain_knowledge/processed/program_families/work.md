# Work Permits – Overview (DRAFT)

## Overview
Temporary work authorization for foreign nationals; pathways to PR via CEC/PNP/EE. Includes employer-specific (often LMIA-backed) and open permit categories.

## Sub-programs / Streams (examples)
- Employer-specific (LMIA-based or LMIA-exempt)
- Open work permits (spousal, PGWP, IEC)
- International Experience Canada (youth mobility)

## Eligibility Structure (high-level)
- Depends on stream: job offer + LMIA (or exemption), occupation/NOC, employer compliance, admissibility, sometimes provincial ties.

## Key Decision Dimensions
- LMIA status, NOC/TEER, employer, province, permit type (open vs employer-specific), duration.

## Typical Journeys
- Employer obtains LMIA or exemption → candidate applies for work permit → works in Canada → may accumulate Canadian experience for CEC/PNP/EE.

## Implementation Hints
- Represent permits with type, LMIA/exemption flag, employer/NOC linkage, validity dates; feed Canadian experience into CRS/eligibility engines.

## Status
- DRAFT – requires SME/legal review before production.
