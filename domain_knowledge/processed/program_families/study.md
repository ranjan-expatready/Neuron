# Study Pathways – Overview (DRAFT)

## Overview
Study permits for international students, with pathways to work (PGWP) and potential PR via CEC/PNP/EE.

## Sub-programs / Streams (high-level)
- Study Permit (DLI acceptance, financial proof, intent to study)
- Work while studying (on/off campus rules)
- Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) after eligible programs

## Eligibility Structure (high-level)
- DLI acceptance, financial sufficiency, language (institution-driven), intent/temporary resident intent, admissibility.
- PGWP eligibility tied to program length/type and full-time study.

## Key Decision Dimensions
- DLI status, program length, province, funds, language, past study in Canada.

## Typical Journeys
- Receive DLI offer → apply for study permit with proof of funds/docs → study → (optionally) PGWP → transition to work/PR pathways.

## Implementation Hints
- Model study permits separately from EE/PNP but capture attributes (DLI, program length, funds) for downstream PGWP/CEC eligibility.
- Track PGWP eligibility and validity for future EE/PNP applications.

## Status
