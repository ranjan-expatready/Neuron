# Provincial Nominee Programs (PNP) – Overview (DRAFT)

## Overview
Province/territory-driven programs to attract candidates aligned with regional needs. May be Express Entry–aligned (enhanced) or base (paper-based) streams.

## Sub-programs (examples)
- EE-aligned streams (e.g., Ontario HCP, BC EE streams, Alberta Express Entry)
- Employer-driven or occupation-in-demand base streams
- Regional/rural pilots administered provincially

## Eligibility Structure (high-level)
- Province-specific criteria layered on top of federal admissibility (and EE eligibility for enhanced streams).
- Factors: occupation/NOC/TEER, job offer, work/study in province, language, education, settlement funds, intent to reside.

## Key Decision Dimensions
- Province/territory, occupation alignment, job offer/LMIA, language thresholds, prior provincial ties (study/work), CRS (for EE-aligned).

## Typical Journeys
- Candidate meets a province’s criteria → receives NOI or applies directly → obtains nomination → (if EE-aligned) receives 600 CRS points and ITA; otherwise proceeds paper-based.

## Implementation Hints
- Represent provincial streams as configurable rule sets referencing core building blocks (language, work, NOC/TEER, funds).
- Store nomination data for CRS additional points when EE-aligned.

## Status
- DRAFT – requires SME/legal review before production.
