# Humanitarian & Pilots – Overview (DRAFT)

## Overview
Special measures, pilots, and humanitarian pathways (e.g., refugee programs, RNIP/AIP, caregiver pilots). Highly program-specific; criteria change over time.

## Sub-programs / Streams (examples)
- Refugee/humanitarian resettlement programs.
- Economic pilots (RNIP, AIP), caregiver pilots.
- Ad hoc special measures (country/region-specific) — must be tracked via raw sources.

## Eligibility Structure (high-level)
- Program-specific; may include community/employer ties (RNIP/AIP), occupation lists, language/education thresholds, job offers, humanitarian criteria.

## Key Decision Dimensions
- Program identifier, location/community, occupation/NOC, employer, language/education, funds, admissibility, special documentation.

## Typical Journeys
- Applicant meets program-specific criteria → community/employer endorsement or referral → application → biometrics/medicals/background → decision.

## Implementation Hints
- Model pilots as configurable rule bundles with versioning; expect frequent updates and sunset dates. Link each to raw source references.

## Sources
- See `domain_knowledge/raw/humanitarian_pilots/sources.md`.

## Status
- DRAFT – requires SME/legal review before production.
