# Family Sponsorship – Overview (DRAFT)

## Overview
Allows Canadian citizens/PRs to sponsor eligible family members (spouse/partner, children, parents/grandparents, select others) for PR.

## Sub-programs / Streams
- Spouse/Partner (inland/outland)
- Dependent Children
- Parents/Grandparents (PGP)
- Other limited relatives (case-specific)

## Eligibility Structure (high-level)
- Relationship eligibility, sponsor income/undertaking requirements, admissibility, residence/intent to reside.
- Medicals/police/background checks for applicants.

## Key Decision Dimensions
- Relationship type, sponsor status (citizen/PR), sponsor income (PGP), cohabitation/residency, province (for some nuances like CSQ in Quebec).

## Typical Journeys
- Sponsor prepares package → submits with proof of relationship and income (if applicable) → biometrics/medicals/background → decision → landing.

## Implementation Hints
- Model sponsorship cases with sponsor/applicant roles, relationship type, income checks (where applicable), and document sets per stream.
