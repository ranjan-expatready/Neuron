# Visitor / Temporary – Overview (DRAFT)

## Overview
Temporary entry for tourism, business visits, or short-term family visits (TRV/super visa where applicable).

## Sub-programs / Streams
- Visitor Visa (TRV)
- Super Visa (parents/grandparents)
- eTA (for visa-exempt air travelers; not a visa but entry requirement)

## Eligibility Structure (high-level)
- Purpose of travel, ties to home country, financial sufficiency, admissibility, invitation/support (where applicable), insurance (super visa).

## Key Decision Dimensions
- Purpose, length of stay, funds, travel history, family ties, insurance (super visa), biometrics requirement.

## Typical Journeys
- Apply for TRV/eTA with purpose and supporting documents → biometrics (if required) → decision → entry to Canada.

## Implementation Hints
- Capture visit purpose, funds, ties evidence; differentiate super visa requirements (insurance, relationship).
