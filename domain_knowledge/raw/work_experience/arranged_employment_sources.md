# Arranged Employment — RAW SOURCES (DRAFT, NOT LEGAL ADVICE)

> Internal engineering reference; summarize IRCC wording. SME/legal validation required.

## Job offer & LMIA basics

- SOURCE: IRCC Express Entry eligibility / work experience guidance (same family as CRS/criteria pages used previously).
- EXTRACTED_NOTES:
  - Valid job offer for EE must be full-time, non-seasonal, paid, and for at least 1 year after issuance of PR visa.
  - Typically requires LMIA unless exempt (e.g., certain intra-company transfers/LMIA-exempt employer-specific permits).
  - Job offer must be in TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3 to count for EE arranged employment.
  - Offer must be from up to two employers (if combined) and supported by written offer details; employer(s) must be eligible and compliant.

## Express Entry and arranged employment

- SOURCE: IRCC EE/CRS rules pages (used in CRS docs) for arranged employment context.
- EXTRACTED_NOTES:
  - Arranged employment can affect eligibility (e.g., supports FST when combined with certification) and CRS points (points captured separately in CRS docs).
  - For FSW/CEC, job offer is not always required but can strengthen profile; must meet TEER and duration criteria to be considered “valid.”
  - LMIA-exempt employer-specific work permits (e.g., certain international agreements) may still qualify if they meet IRCC’s “valid job offer” definition.
  - Job offer location may determine PNP relevance; province-specific rules apply when nomination is involved (out of scope here).

Status: DRAFT – high-level extraction only; SME/legal validation required.
