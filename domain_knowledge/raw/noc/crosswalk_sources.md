## NOC 2021 TEER structure

- SOURCE: Official NOC 2021 (ESDC/Job Bank) descriptions for TEER levels 0–5.
- EXTRACTED_NOTES:
  - TEER 0: management occupations (senior/functional managers).
  - TEER 1: occupations usually requiring a university degree.
  - TEER 2: occupations usually requiring a college diploma/2–3 years apprenticeship or supervisory roles.
  - TEER 3: occupations usually requiring ≤2 years college/apprenticeship or >6 months training.
  - TEER 4: occupations usually requiring secondary school or on-the-job training.
  - TEER 5: short work demonstrations; no formal education required.

## Skilled vs non-skilled for Express Entry

- SOURCE: IRCC Express Entry work experience guidance (consistent with work_experience sources).
- EXTRACTED_NOTES:
  - TEER 0, 1, 2, 3 are considered “skilled” for Express Entry core programs (FSW, CEC, FST as applicable).
  - TEER 4 and 5 are not eligible for EE core programs directly; may appear in some PNP streams (outside CRS or province-specific).
  - Engine must treat TEER 0–3 as eligible for skilled work experience; TEER 4–5 as ineligible unless overridden by PNP rules.

## NOC usage for eligibility checks

- SOURCE: IRCC/Job Bank NOC finder guidance used in prior cycles.
- EXTRACTED_NOTES:
  - Candidates must match NOC lead statement and most main duties for claimed NOC.
  - Work experience must be in the same NOC code for FSW 1-year continuous requirement; for other programs, multiple NOCs may be acceptable if skilled and within program rules.
  - Use NOC 2021 codes (structure: 5-digit) with TEER mapping to determine skilled eligibility; do not embed full code tables—rely on external lookup.
