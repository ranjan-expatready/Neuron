## 🚀 Start in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Give High-Level Goal

```
@Product Manager/CTO Agent:

Implement Phase 1 core features:
- Case management (full CRUD, lifecycle)
- Client portal (case list, detail, progress)
- Document upload (secure, OCR, validation)
- Gold-class quality (80%+ tests, security, performance)

Break down, assign to agents, execute, and update knowledge base.
Report status weekly.
```

### Step 2: Check Status (Weekly)

```
@Product Manager/CTO Agent: Status update. What's done? Any blockers?
```

### Step 3: Give Feedback (If Needed)

```
@Product Manager/CTO Agent: Prioritize mobile responsiveness in client portal.
```

**That's it!** Agent handles everything else.
