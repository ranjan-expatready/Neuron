These commandments are listed in order of precedence. When conflicts arise:
1. Higher-numbered commandments yield to lower-numbered ones
2. Legal requirements (Commandment I) override all other considerations
3. Client interests (Commandment II) take precedence over system efficiency
4. Professional standards (Commandment III) cannot be compromised for convenience

### Violation Response
Violations of these commandments trigger immediate response:
- **Critical Violations**: System shutdown until resolution
- **Major Violations**: Immediate escalation to senior management
- **Minor Violations**: Rapid correction and process improvement
- **All Violations**: Root cause analysis and prevention measures

### Amendment Process
These commandments can only be amended through:
1. Unanimous consent of the Governance Committee
2. Legal counsel review and approval
3. Stakeholder consultation period
4. Formal documentation and communication

### Monitoring and Compliance
- Automated monitoring for commandment compliance
- Regular audits by independent third parties
- Continuous training on commandment requirements
