# Engineering Governance

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document defines the FAANG-style governance loop for every agent (Cursor, GPT, automation scripts, humans) working on Neuron-2. Always read and follow these rules **before** writing code, tests, or docs so that persistent memory, product status, and blueprint intent stay aligned.

## 2. Agent Bootstrap Checklist

1. **Load runtime + knowledge paths:** Read `.ai-knowledge-base.json` (backend/frontend commands, CI behavior, blueprint links).
2. **Review product status:** Read `PRODUCT_LOG.md` to understand which features/sections are ✅, 🟡, 🧩, or ⛔.
3. **Review latest engineering changes:** Read the last few entries in `.ai-memory/ENGINEERING_LOG.md`.
4. **Skim relevant blueprint docs:**
   - Always: `blueprint/00_BLUEPRINT_INDEX.md`
   - Product/features: 01, 02, 03, 04, 13, 14
   - Architecture/infra/test strategy: 05, 06, 07, 08, 11
   - Operations/support: 12
   - AI/agents/automation: 09
5. **Confirm branch:** Use `main` for reading; create/checkout a dedicated feature branch (`feature/<name>`) before making changes.
6. **Confirm CI guardrails:** `backend-tests` (pytest + ≥80% coverage) and `frontend-tests` (lint + build) are required status checks on `main`. Local work should mirror those commands.

## 3. Change Types & Required Memory Updates

| Type                                             | Definition                                                                    | Required updates                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type A – Backend feature / bugfix**            | Touches `backend/src/app/**`, `backend/tests/**`, schemas, services, or APIs. | - Add/adjust backend tests.<br>- Append ENGINEERING_LOG entry (include date, `[backend][area]` tags, summary, key files).<br>- Update PRODUCT_LOG section A/C if behavior or API is user-visible. |
| **Type B – Frontend feature / bugfix**           | Touches `frontend/src/**`, Next.js routes, frontend tests, Playwright flows.  | - Add/adjust frontend/unit/E2E tests.<br>- ENGINEERING_LOG entry with `[frontend]` tag.<br>- PRODUCT_LOG section B/C/E if UX changes (screens, flows, data shown).                                |
| **Type C – Infra / CI / DevOps**                 | Touches workflows, Makefiles, Docker, scripts, runtime automation.            | - ENGINEERING_LOG entry with `[infra][ci]` tags.<br>- PRODUCT_LOG section F bullet describing the new guardrail/tooling.                                                                          |
| **Type D – AI/Agent / Automation / CRS / Brain** | Touches agent prompts, automation, CRS calculators, orchestration.            | - ENGINEERING_LOG entry `[ai][automation]`.<br>- PRODUCT_LOG section D/E bullet describing capability & blueprints referenced.<br>- Reference blueprint/09, blueprint/13 as appropriate.          |
| **Type E – Documentation-only**                  | Pure docs (blueprint updates, guides, runbooks) without code.                 | - ENGINEERING_LOG entry `[docs]` when material (new requirements, workflows, policies).<br>- PRODUCT_LOG only if doc introduces/retire user-facing functionality.                                 |

**Example ENGINEERING_LOG entry (Type C):**

```
## 2025-12-05 – [ci][devops] CI guardrails live on main
- [branch-protection] Required `backend-tests` + `frontend-tests`, strict up-to-date, no force pushes.
- [ci] Renamed workflow jobs so each status has a unique context; reran pipelines (green).
- [docs] Updated PRODUCT_LOG section F to describe guardrails for future agents.
```

**Example PRODUCT_LOG bullet (Type B):**

```
- ✅ Client login UX hardened – `/auth/login` now uses JSON endpoint, adds inline validation, and redirects to `/dashboard` after success.
```

## 4. Engineering Log Format

- File: `.ai-memory/ENGINEERING_LOG.md`
- Heading format: `## YYYY-MM-DD – [tags] short summary`
- Use concise bullets (3–6 lines) covering:
  - Area (backend/frontend/infra/ai/docs).
  - Key modules or files.
  - Tests/CI impact or follow-up work.
- Always append (never rewrite history). List newest entry at the top.

## 5. Product Log Usage

- `PRODUCT_LOG.md` is the single source of truth for product readiness (sections A–F).
- Any change that affects user-visible behavior, roadmap status, or Go-To-Market messaging **must** update the relevant section.
- Before proposing or building new work, agents MUST read PRODUCT_LOG to avoid duplicating completed work or diverging from roadmap priorities.

## 6. Governance Loop Summary

1. **Before coding:** Run the Agent Bootstrap Checklist (Section 2).
2. **During implementation:** Keep each change scoped to one change type when possible; follow its required memory/product updates.
3. **Before pushing:** Run relevant tests (backend-tests, frontend-tests, e2e if touched). Update ENGINEERING_LOG (and PRODUCT_LOG if applicable).
4. **On PR:** Ensure `backend-tests` and `frontend-tests` are green, and reference the ENGINEERING_LOG entry (date + tags) in the PR description.
5. **After merge:** Confirm logs/KB are committed so future sessions can resume seamlessly.

## 7. Domain Knowledge Check (IRCC / Immigration)

- Applies to any CRS, eligibility, checklist, questionnaire, or workflow item tied to immigration rules.
- **Before implementation:**
  1. Locate the relevant backlog ID in `PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` to confirm scope/dependencies.
  2. Review `domain_knowledge/` (raw + processed) for the supporting IRCC/PNP evidence.
  3. If evidence is missing or marked draft, use Octagon (or the approved research tool) to discover official sources and propose what to ingest.
  4. Ask the human owner to confirm priority documents and authorize storing them under `domain_knowledge/raw/`.
  5. Summarize into `domain_knowledge/processed/` with citations and validation status before writing code.
- Draft summaries are acceptable for development, but production-critical logic must be reviewed by an immigration SME.
- **Octagon may accelerate research and drafting, but `domain_knowledge/` remains the canonical store for immigration rules.**

## 8. Config-First Domain Rules

- All immigration rules (CRS, eligibility thresholds, documents, points) must be sourced from `config/domain/*.yaml` (config-first layer). No hard-coded domain constants are permitted in backend/src or frontend/src.
- Any domain rule change MUST:
  1. Update `config/domain/*.yaml` with the new values and notes.
  2. Add/adjust tests covering the affected logic.
  3. Append `.ai-memory/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` with date/tags/summary.
  4. Update `PRODUCT_LOG.md` / `PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` when user-visible behavior or roadmap scope changes.
- Services should consume domain config through a dedicated ConfigService (validated, cached), not ad hoc file reads.
- Keep configs versioned and mark status (DRAFT/REVIEWED) before production use.

## 9. Domain Knowledge Check (IRCC / Immigration)

- **Trigger:** Any backlog item or change touching CRS scoring, eligibility logic, questionnaires, document checklists, workflows, or other immigration-specific functionality.
- **Required steps:**
  1. Look up the related backlog ID in `PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` to understand scope and dependencies.
  2. Review `domain_knowledge/` (raw + processed) for the authoritative IRCC/PNP material that supports the change.
  3. If the needed evidence is missing or unverified:
     - Use Octagon (or the assigned research tool) to discover official sources and propose what should be downloaded.
     - Coordinate with the human owner to confirm priority sources and approve storing them under `domain_knowledge/raw/`.
     - Summarize into `domain_knowledge/processed/` with source citations and validation status before shipping code.
  4. Keep drafts clearly labeled until a subject-matter expert reviews them; production-critical rules must not ship without review.
- Agents may leverage Octagon to accelerate research and drafting, **but `domain_knowledge/` remains the canonical store for immigration rules**. Always update the repository before implementing or modifying domain logic.


## Observability & SRE (M4.4)
- Preserve and propagate `X-Request-ID` for every backend request.
- Use structured logging helpers in `backend/src/app/observability/logging.py`; log IDs only (no PII).
- Maintain health/readiness endpoints (`/internal/healthz`, `/internal/readyz`) and metrics (`/internal/metrics`) for all deployed services.
