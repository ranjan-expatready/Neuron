# Quick Start: Batch Autonomous Work

## Maximize Autonomous Work Per Session

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

**AI agents cannot run 24/7 autonomously in the background.** They require active sessions.

**However, we can maximize autonomous work within sessions using "Batch Autonomous Mode"!**

---

## 🚀 How to Start

### Batch Autonomous Work (Recommended):

```
@Product Manager/CTO Agent:

Start batch autonomous work. Work through as many tasks as possible in this session.
Process tasks in priority order (P0 → P1 → P2). After each task:
- Run tests
- Check coverage
- Update knowledge base
- Report progress

Continue until:
- All tasks complete, OR
- All phases complete, OR
- Session time limit reached

Report status every 5 tasks. Show me what's done, what's next, and completion estimate.

Proceed.
```

**That's it!** CTO Agent will:

- ✅ Work through multiple tasks in sequence
- ✅ Check quality after each task
- ✅ Report progress every 5 tasks
- ✅ Continue until complete or session ends

---

### Resume Work (Next Session):

```
@Product Manager/CTO Agent:

Good morning. Resume batch autonomous work. Read knowledge base to see what's done.
Continue from where we left off. Work through remaining tasks. Report status.

Proceed.
```

**Agent will:**

- ✅ Read knowledge base
- ✅ See what's completed
- ✅ Continue with next tasks
- ✅ Work through as many as possible

---

## 📊 Check Status Anytime

```
@Product Manager/CTO Agent:

What's the autonomous operation status? Show me:
- Current iteration
- Tasks completed
- Requirements coverage
- Test coverage
- Completion estimate
- Any blockers

Proceed.
```

---

## 🛑 How to Stop

### Graceful Stop:

```
@Product Manager/CTO Agent:

Stop autonomous operation gracefully. Save current state and report status.

Proceed.
```

### Or Press Ctrl+C (if running script)

---

## ✅ Completion Criteria

**Project is gold-class complete when ALL are true:**

- ✅ All 4 phases complete
- ✅ All requirements covered (100%)
- ✅ Test coverage 80%+
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Production ready

**CTO will stop automatically when all criteria are met!**

---

## 📋 What Happens

### Every 15-20 Minutes:

1. CTO reads knowledge base
2. Selects next task
3. Executes task
4. Runs tests
5. Updates progress
6. Checks completion

### Every 2 Hours:

- Status report
- Progress update
- Next steps

### On Completion:

- Final report
- All metrics
- Production readiness

**Just enable it and let it run! 🚀**
